Zetitus Lepetus!
Good thing your not in Vegas?
DM, beat him about the face and neck!
I’m FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE!!!
At least in some universe you didn’t mess that roll up?
Who coded this crap?
It happens to everyone...
Hopefully that roll wasn’t important...
I see you dropped the ball again...
If you were trying to fail, you succeed.
How bad could death really be?
Dear God Eliza, that was a awful roll!
